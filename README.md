# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using JavaScript. The game is played entirely in the console, without any graphical user interface (GUI).

    How to Play

    Open your browser's console (usually by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows/Linux, or Cmd+Option+I on macOS).

    Copy and paste the code into the console.

    The game will start, and you'll be prompted to choose your weapon (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) in the console.

    Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and press Enter.

    The computer will randomly choose its weapon, and the result of the round will be displayed in the console.

    The game continues for 5 rounds, and the score is updated after each round.

    After 5 rounds, the winner is announced in the console.

    You'll be prompted to play again or quit the game.
